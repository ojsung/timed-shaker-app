# timed_shaker

An app to shake your phone at timed intervals

## Current Status
- There's literally nothing in here. I made a home page lol. I'll start getting some code added tomorrow (2023-09-08)

## Features
### Expected Features
- Define different vibration strengths and intervals for deep sleep, dreaming sleep, and light sleep
- Create routines that play different sleep types at set times or intervals
- Allow running in the background to allow user to have _uhhh_ other sleep-tracking apps running in the foreground as their primary app

## Roadmap
### Version 1 (minimum viable product)
#### Homepage
- A play button to start the last used routine
- A dropdown to select a different routine
- A floating action button to navigate to the "New Routine" page or "Edit Sleep Type" page

#### New Routine Page
- New routines can be defined from text fields
- Can define total duration of sleep routine
- Can add periods of each sleep type to a list with set durations for each
- Show a percent of each sleep type based on user input

#### Edit Sleep Type page
- Sleep type to edit can be picked from list
- Can edit vibration duration and strength
- Can edit vibration frequency

### Version 2
- Visual representations replace text percentages
