# timed_shaker

An app to shake your phone at timed intervals

## Current Status
- Pre-alpha, not functional
- Currently working on enabling vibration functions

## Features
### Expected Features
- Define different vibration strengths and intervals for deep sleep, dreaming sleep, and light sleep
- Create routines that play different sleep types at set times or intervals

## Roadmap
### Version 1 (minimum viable product)
#### Homepage
- A play button to start the last used routine

- Can add periods of each sleep type to a list with set durations for each
- Show a percent of each sleep type based on user input

#### Edit Sleep Type page
- Sleep type to edit can be picked from list

### Version 2
